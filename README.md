# OpenWeather-App

I have implmented all the requirements according to the best of my understanding.

Due to lack of time, I missed some aspects that I would've wanted to include otherwise.
If I had more time, I would've refactored some of the code to use interfaces (i.e. protocols) to make those classes more testable.
I could create a complete mock network layer for testing.
